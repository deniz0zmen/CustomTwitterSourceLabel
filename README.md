# CustomTwitterSourceLabel
allows you to tweet from custom device API's on twitter. Twitter devleoper account required. <br />

Install dependencies with "pip install tweepy" <br />

-You need to apply for a twitter developer account (this is very easy and you dont have to make anything up, this bot is a legitimate reason). <br />
-Once in you need to create a new app and get the consumer keys and generate the access tokens. <br />

CUSTOM SOURCE LABEL WILL NOT APPEAR UNTIL 3 HOURS HAVE PASSED SINCE APP CREATION. <br /> <br />

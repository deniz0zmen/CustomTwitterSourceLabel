# CustomTwitterSourceLabel
allows you to tweet from custom device API's on twitter. Twitter devleoper account required.

Install dependencies with "pip install tweepy"

-You need to apply for a twitter developer account (this is very easy and you dont have to make anything up, this bot is a legitimate reason).
-Once in you need to create a new app and get the consumer keys and generate the access tokens.

CUSTOM SOURCE LABEL WILL NOT APPEAR UNTIL 3 HOURS HAVE PASSED SINCE APP CREATION.
